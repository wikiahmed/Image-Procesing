This project demonstrates a simple color picker interface using OpenCV and NumPy. The application allows users to dynamically adjust the RGB values of a blank canvas and switch between an "ON" and "OFF" state. The color values can be modified in real-time using trackbars.

## Features
- Dynamically update canvas colors in real-time using RGB trackbars.
- "ON/OFF" switch to toggle the canvas between a selected color and black.
- Built with Python, leveraging OpenCV for GUI functionality.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
OpenCV library (`cv2`)
NumPy library (`numpy`)
